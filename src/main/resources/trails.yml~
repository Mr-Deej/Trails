trails:
  ## Name of trail type. Can be any name, and you can create any number of trails
  Grass:
    ## Links in the Trail. Each 'link' is a Material, a minimum number of walks to degrade the trail,
    ## a maximum number of walks to degrade the trail, and a percentage chance(in whole integers) that
    ## the trail will degrade when in between the minimum and maximum number of walks. The 'link' will degrade
    ## to the next number down. Each link must be named a number like in the example trails below. There must be
    ## at least two links in each trail. (Or else what would GRASS degrade into?) The Last link's walks and 
    ## chances are ignored as there won't be an additional link for the block to degrade into.
